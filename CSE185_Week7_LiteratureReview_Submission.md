# Summary 

The goal of this study is to use informative molecular markers to predict externally visible characteristics (EVC). The objective of this study is to improve forensic DNA phenotyping which predicting phenotype only based on genotype. To predict EVC, they developed a single multiplex genotyping system called IrisPlex. It used six SNPs that associated with eye-colour the most to perdic blue and brown eye colour. These six SNPs are from HERC2, OCA2, SLC24A4, MATP, TYR and IR. To predict blue and brown eyes, they used a previously published formula which bases on multinomial logistic regression model and the six SNPs. Moreover, DNA was extracted from 40 volunteers using QIAamp DNA mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and used the 6 SNPs to test accuracy of IrisPlex. In addition, 934 individuals were genotyped for all markers.Data on 40 individual from different geographical region were used to represent the prediction strength of IrisPlex. Using the 6 SNP prediction model, they obtained an accuracy rate of 925% or 37 individuals’ prediction matched with eye colour phenotype.  Using 0.7 as the probability threshold, the accuracy was 91.6% for blue eye colour and 6% for brown eye colour. However, if lowering the probialit threshold to 0.5, the accuracy increased to 87.5% for brown eye colour and remain unchanged for blue eye colour. This result demonstrated that phenotyping using only DNA has a high accuracy on the prediction. It also proven that forensic DNA phenotyping can be used as a biological witness in suitable forensic cases.

# Tutorial Comparison

The prediction model that we used in our in-class tutorial correspond to multinomial logistic regression model mentioned in the statistical analysis section of the article. Instead of testing the performance of the model with 40 individuals, we tested it with 206 samples using spreadsheet with the formula to calculate the probability of eye color of an individual. Moreover, the article does not mention what software they used to calculated the probability of each prediction. In general the methods that we used in tutorial were the same as the one in the article. We used the same prediction model to predict eye color on the same 6 SNPs. 

The general result obtained from our prediction model agreed with the result from the article. We further analysis the data by separating into two samples based on population. We predicted that northern European population would have a higher rate of getting blue eye color than southern European population. This finding was agreeing with the result produced in the article. However, the eye color associated SNPs that we obtained from part 1 of the tutorials were different from the 6 SNPs in the article and in the prediction model.  This difference could be due the the different method of clustering and finding the principal component in the data. In the tutorial, it asked a different questions than the article raised which is predicting the probability of a child will inherit the blue eye color based on the parent’s genotype. This question is asked in the tutorial because it allow us to recognize the extensive application of forensic DNA genotyping if phenotype was only determined by genotype. This question allow us to think on the application of such model.
