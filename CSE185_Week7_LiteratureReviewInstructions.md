# CSE185 Spring 2018 Literature Review Guidlines (Wekk 7)

For this assignment, you will read the primary research that one of the class labs is based on, then focus in on one particular section of the paper and explain it to your classmates.

Instead of a lab report for this week, you will be writing a one page review of the article demonstrating your understanding of the paper and how it compares to what we did in class. As usual, this assignment will be due at 11am the next Tuesday (May 22). The written review will be worth the same as a lab report (all lab reports together are worth 60% of your grade), and you will also have the opportunity for a lab notebook point (the 10 questions you bring to class) and attendance points.

For this assignment, you will be editing a Google doc for your group, which will consist of at most 5 people as described in more detail below.

## Monday, May 14

***There is no lecture on Monday, May 14***. Instead, you will be preparing for the literature review on your own. On Monday you should:

* Choose which [paper](https://github.com/gymreklab/cse185-spring18-week7/tree/master/papers) you'd like to focus on.
* Update the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ybWJhlJugX1Vbn0TJyrk_OOurCU3b5jKqDAdgWsdEMA/edit?usp=sharing) with your selection. Please add in the sheet the group you regularly attend. **Update the Google sheet by 9pm Monday night** so we can arrange groups for Tuesday.
* Prepare 10 questions in the document CSE185_Week7_LiteratureReviewQuestions.md

## Tuesday, May 15

When you get to lab you will be given a group assignment based on your paper choice which will be added to the spreadsheet linked above. Someone in your group should create a Google doc for your group and update the spreadsheet with a link to the document (one per group). In this document, as a group you should:

* List the names of the members of your group.
* Make a master list of everyone's questions (removing duplicates), and answer as many as possible using the group's shared knowledge.
* Divide the paper into sections and assign a section to each person (try to make it as even as possible). Start by assigning one figure or table to each person, and only if those get used up, assign
the intro or methods section. Make sure that all the figures and tables are covered, even if you have to assign more than one per person. List these sections and the name of the person responsible on the Google doc.

For the rest of the lab session and at home before Thursday: examine the section you've been assigned more closely, and try to understand it well enough that you can summarize and present it to your group in ~2-3 minutes on Thursday.

## Thursday, May 17

In the same group as Tuesday, you will:

* Present your section to the group (should take 2-3 minutes per person, although this should be a discussion so it's ok to run over on this one.). Then as a group try to answer questions that anyone might have. If you have a figure/table, be sure to explain what the axes/columns and rows are, how the data was obtained, and what the general trends/takeaway result is for each figure. If you have an intro/methods section, explain the meaning of any unfamiliar concepts or procedures. This should be collaborative, so everyone in the group is allowed to chime in with their interpretation. 
* Fill out any additional answers to the questions from Tuesday that you were able to figure out.
* For each section that was assigned a presenter, write 3-4 sentences summarizing that section.
* Finally, figure out where the data for the lab tutorial came from for each paper. Depending on the paper, data came from either the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), or PRIDE. You should be able to find the accession numbers somewhere in the paper and use what we learned about finding raw data in Wednesday's lecture.
* If there is any more time, if the paper involved any tools not already installed for the class on `ieng6`, choose one and figure out how to install it on `ieng6`.

## At home
Use the Google doc from your group to help you write your review (but put things in your own words). The review should not exceed one single-spaced (12 pt font) page (if you submit a PDF) or a comparable length if you submit a markdown file. Submit your report by adding to Github with the filename CSE185_Week7_LiteratureReview_Submission.

Please follow the format below. If you use other articles (perhaps to look up previous work) add a citations section at the end. For the summary section, do not simply paraphrase the paperâ€™s abstract - try to summarize based on your understanding of the entire article.
